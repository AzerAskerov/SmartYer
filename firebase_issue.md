# Firebase Integration Requirements

## Current Status
Currently using mock data and simulated services. Need to implement real Firebase services for production.

## Required Firebase Services

### 1. Authentication
- Implement Firebase Authentication for user management
- Support email/password and social login (Google, Facebook)
- User profile management
- Session handling

### 2. Realtime Database/Firestore
- Store and sync business data in real-time
- Business details, reviews, ratings
- User preferences and history
- Location-based queries
- Offline data persistence

### 3. Cloud Storage
- Store business images and user uploads
- Profile pictures
- Business photo galleries
- Review attachments

### 4. Cloud Functions
- Implement serverless functions for:
  - Search indexing
  - Notifications
  - Data aggregation
  - Location-based calculations

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up Firebase project and configure for Android
2. Install required NuGet packages:
   - FirebaseDatabase.net
   - FirebaseAuthentication.net
   - FirebaseStorage.net
3. Update services to use Firebase:
   - BusinessService
   - LocationService
   - AuthenticationService
4. Implement offline data sync
5. Add real-time updates for business data
6. Implement proper error handling and retry logic

## Security Considerations
- Implement proper Firebase security rules
- Secure API keys and credentials
- Handle user permissions
- Data validation

## Dependencies
- Firebase Admin SDK
- Google Play Services
- Firebase Core
- Firebase Analytics

## Additional Requirements
- Implement proper error handling
- Add retry logic for network failures
- Cache management
- Performance monitoring
- Analytics integration

- [.NET MAUI Firebase Integration Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/dotnet/setup)
- [Firebase Security Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User authentication working with multiple providers
- [ ] Real-time data sync implemented
- [ ] Offline functionality working
- [ ] Location-based queries optimized
- [ ] Security rules properly configured
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic in place
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable range
